# Notice for This Repository

Hello, my name is Rohan Sirohi. I have been working as an IT admin for the past six months, and these are some guides that I have compiled based on my experiences during this time. They have proven to be quite helpful, as I no longer need to search elsewhere for specific solutions when I know they are documented in the wiki.

# Contributions

Yes, contributions are open, and you are most welcome to work on this repository.

# Note

I am not a Git master; I am currently in the learning phase. I will soon update the branch and make other necessary improvements to ensure that it looks cool and stays updated.
